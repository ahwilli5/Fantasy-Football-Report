# Fantasy-Football-Report
This is a Python script that allows you to input your personal league information and it will generate a personalized report for your team of choice and give a year-end review of that team's season. This will require you to obtain the information needed to access your team's league information and the program will automatically generate a PDF report for a fantasy team owner for a current/past fantasy season. A representative report for my Fantasy team's 2019 season is posted. To generate a report for your own league, you will need the league ID and, if your league is private, you will need to enter your swid and espn_2 values, which can be found using this guide:
